**Headline (H3)**: The $28 Billion Crisis Hidden in Every Lab

**Body Text**: 
Scientific research faces a reproducibility crisis that costs over $28 billion annually in the US alone. The root causes are systematic:

**Key Problems** (with icons):
- ⏱️ **Time-Consuming Documentation**: Scientists spend up to 20% of their time on manual record-keeping
- ⚠️ **Costly Human Errors**: Procedural mistakes destroy weeks of work and expensive reagents
- 🧠 **Lost Tacit Knowledge**: Critical "how-to" expertise disappears when experienced researchers leave

**Visual Element**: Large "$28B" graphic with subtitle "Lost annually to irreproducible research"

## Section 3: Our Solution
*Background: White*

### Content
**Headline (H3)**: Beyond Documentation - True Verification

**Body Text**:
SciSymbio is pioneering the first AI-powered lab companion that creates verifiable, visual evidence of experimental procedures. Our integrated system combines:

- **Smart Audio Interface**: Hands-free protocol guidance and real-time calculations
- **Computer Vision**: Clip-on camera technology that captures the physical reality of experiments  
- **AI Analysis**: Specialized algorithms that understand scientific procedures and generate structured, auditable protocols

**Key Innovation**: We don't just record what happened - we create an objective "source of truth" that proves how experiments were actually performed.

## Section 4: Why Now
*Background: Light grey (#F8F9FA)*

### Content
**Headline (H3)**: The Perfect Convergence

**Body Text**:
Three critical factors make our vision achievable today:

1. **AI Maturity**: Advanced computer vision and language models can now understand complex laboratory procedures
2. **Hardware Accessibility**: Miniaturized cameras and processing power make unobtrusive lab integration possible
3. **Market Urgency**: The $20B+ Life Science IT market is actively seeking solutions to the reproducibility crisis
